# Project Issues

## ✅ Tmux Initialization Errors
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Description**: Terminal displays "can't find session: default" and "open terminal failed: not a terminal" upon startup.
- **Resolution**: Added interactivity check `[[ -o interactive ]]` and suppressed stderr for the initial attach attempt in `.zshrc`.

## ✅ Slow Homebrew Installations (Cleanup)
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Description**: `brew install` triggers an automatic cleanup process that takes a significant amount of time.
- **Resolution**: Set `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1` in `.zshrc` to disable automatic cleanup after every installation.

## ✅ Alt Key Compatibility (macOS & Ubuntu)
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Description**: Alt/Option shortcuts (like Alt+p) were not registered by Tmux.
- **Resolution**: 
    - Implemented `common/fix-alt-keys.sh` which automates the disabling of GNOME Terminal menu accelerators on Ubuntu.
    - Provided clear in-terminal instructions for configuring macOS Terminal.app and iTerm2 to use "Option as Meta".
    - Added a "Fix Alt Keys" entry to the Command Palette for instant troubleshooting.
